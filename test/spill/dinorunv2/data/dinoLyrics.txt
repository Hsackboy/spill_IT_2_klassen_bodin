[Verse]
Bouncing through the jungle
With a beat in my chest
Running like a dino
On a wild quest
Chasing after love
Gotta save the day
Gonna catch that baby
No one gets away

Zooming through the forest
With a fire in my eyes
Stomping like a T-Rex
Reaching for the skies
Dodging every obstacle
Nothing can stop me
I'm a techno runner
Setting my love free

[Verse 2]
Jumping over lava
With my heart on my sleeve
Gotta find that baby
Make them never wanna leave
Feel the rhythm pumping
Hear the bass drop
In this crazy world
Love is never gonna stop
